Overall basis:
    Characters will be given 6 base major stats (mostly D&D stats) strength, dexterity, constitution, intellegence, creativity, charisma. 
    Characters will have an unlimited amount of minor stats. These stats will be used to determine events that may take place for them. 
        An example would be an animal lover. If the stat is low then any events involving animals will generally not occur for this character. If it were high they would have much more animal events.

    All stats will be a number between 1 and 100. A 1 represents no interest or hate for the subject. 100 represents love or extreme interest for the subject.
    A 0 in any number means that it is not applicable yet.

    When a character is born they are given base stats in all major stats and a large chunk of minor stats. Generally a base stat will be anywhere between 20 - 50.
    Some minor stats are not immediatly applicable (For example MagicCapacity in a world without magic). As such it is set to 0.
    0's in a stat will make it impossible for events that require that stat to occur.

    Children walk around aimlessly most of the time until they grow up into adults after 20 days.
    At 20 days they are automatically given a hobby and become an adult.
