This text document will just hold general game ideas as well as writing anything down that I need to remember or think about during the coding process.

Different races available to the characters (Male and female for each):
White,
Black,
Elven,
Orc,
Dwarf,
Undead,
Demon,
Robot,
Alien

Ideas:
How should the achievement unlocked show the characters doing the achievement.
