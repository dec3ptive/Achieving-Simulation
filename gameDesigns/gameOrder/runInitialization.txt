A large part of the game is initializing a run. During run initialization the player is allowed to create up to seven characters. Each character's stats may be changed depending on if
the player has achieved certain achievements in previous runs. For example you can only change a characters wrath stat assuming you have achieved a 100 stat on wrath previously.

Once they have been previously achieved you can:
You can change a character to hate or like other characters
You can change the current world state.
You can place any buildings.
You can edit any character and their stats.
