Event design:
    Events will be split into these categories:
        Minor: A character partakes in a rather regular action such as eating, painting.
        Major: A character partakes in a rather distinct action such as murder, new religion creation.
        Conflicting: A character partakes in a action directly opposing to another characters action such as fighting, stopping someone from hunting due to high animal love stat.
        Mingling: A character partakes in a action that directly requires another character such as kissing, 
        Voting: All characters vote on a subject matter at a days start about community goals such as building creation, leader voting.
        WorldChanging: An event occurs that changes the landscape such as a volcano going off, extreme rainstorms led to jungle growth.
        Legendary: An event that is extremely unlikely occurs. Such as a character ascending to godhood, a portal to another dimension occurs. These are quite often just rare versions of other events.

    All events are associated with an achievement the first time they take place.
    Some events cause little to no change. Other cause drastic changes. Generally major changes will change character stats quite a lot, while minor ones have little effect on character stats.
    Legendary events have the intent of thorough achievement hunting, they generally don't just go off randomly.
    On a day start the order of operations will be:
        worldChanging
        voting
        legendary
        minor, major
        conflicting, mingling

    Since all character chosen events will occur simaltaneously conflicting/mingling may only occur if two characters are at the same location.
